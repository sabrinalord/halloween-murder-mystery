  <p>The year is 1989 and there's a new celebrity in town.<br>
  <br>
  Nobody had heard of Sandrine before but somehow she's getting the lead in all the hottest films.  She's staring opposite Tom Cruise in her next film and her terrible album is mysteriously climbing the charts. 
  <br> 
  <br> Sandrine's throwing a Halloween party, anyone who's anyone will be there...including her weird, misfit husband, Erik.
  <br>
  <br>
  Something strange is definetely going on here. Rumour has it, it's best to stay on the right side of Sandrine...
